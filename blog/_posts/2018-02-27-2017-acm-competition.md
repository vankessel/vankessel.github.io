================

I went back to the ACM programming competition!
This year I participated in division 1 with my teammates Xingyu and Jeff.
Division 1 has harder questions and the winners will have a chance at finals, hosted in Bejing.
We ended up getting 10th place which I'm more than happy with considering there were 72 teams competing in division 1 and around teams 160 overall.

You can check out the exact standings and questions for any year [here.](http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/results.htm)
The questions can be quite tough and make for good practice.
