I went back to the ACM programming competition, this year it was hosted at the UBC Vancouver campus. I participated in division 1 with my teammates Xingyu and Jeff. Division 1 has more difficult questions than division 2, and the winners will have a chance at the world finals hosted in Beijing. We ended up getting 10th place which I'm more than happy with considering there were 72 teams competing in division 1 and 166 teams overall.
