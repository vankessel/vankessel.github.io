I went back to the ACM programming competition! This year I participated in division 1 with my teammates Xingyu and Jeff. Division 1 has harder questions and the winners will have a chance at finals, hosted in Beijing. We ended up getting 10th place which I'm more than happy with considering there were 72 teams competing in division 1 and 166 teams overall.

You can check out the exact standings and questions for any year [here.](http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/results.htm) The questions can be quite tough and make for good practice.
