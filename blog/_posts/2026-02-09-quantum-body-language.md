## Wait, really?

Did you know it is [not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5qx3cw/connected_as_one_with_hours_of_telepathy/) too [uncommon](https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/86w79u/i_think_my_girlfriend_and_i_are_beginning_to/dw8ecnz/) for [people](https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/apfdkn/do_you_guys_believe_in_telepathy_using_lsd/eg83yvb/) to [experience telepathy on psychedelics](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Psychedelic-Telepathy%3A-An-Interview-Study-Johnstad/d9475810ce25186dab52830b7735f5a905a80dc1)?

I have experienced this myself twice with a friend. We both agreed that there's no way we could have shared what we did in complete silence.

Explanations usually fall into two categories:

1. It's mere hallucination.
2. It's mere body language.

I think it might be a bit more than either.

The brain is not "too warm & wet for quantum mechanics," as [proven April 2024](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07936). (Tryptophan is a key player. Curious, considering the connection to psychedelics.)

This telepathy does not seem to involve [any additional communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem) of information.

How is there an advantage if there is no communication of information?

It's merely that the same amount of information is more efficiently used.

Like a [quantum algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm), it's possible to [exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) [quantum correlations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_correlation) to [do something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP) that [appears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) [remarkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm).

Is there any way to distinguish the correct model of this experience through experiment?

## The Game

Two players attempt to cooperatively win rounds of [the Mermin-Peres magic square game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy#The_magic_square_game).

They can communicate before to strategize, but not during. It's impossible to communicate by measuring entangled qubits, so that is fine.

This game can only be won 8/9 of the time classically, and 100% of the time with only a single pair of entangled qubits.

This seems like a good starting point.

I approached devising an experiment using this game. It's logically sound, but there is a problem of player coordination.

In the classical case, the best outcome involves agreeing beforehand on fixed answers (0 or 1) for each of the 9 board positions.

In the quantum case, the best outcome involves agreeing beforehand on a fixed quantum basis to measure the entangled qubit for each of the 9 positions.

## The Problem

It's easy to memorize a 9 zero or ones.

But it's not even clear if it's possible to consciously choose the quantum basis to measure in.

What if we make it so it doesn't matter if the players are able to coordinate and execute a plan or not?

## A Solution?

Let's model people as Markov chains. (Higher-order Markov chains. With say, a memory of the past 3 or 4 choices made.)

Create two distributions of these "people." The coefficients of their Markov chains being uniformly distributed.

The first population contains people choosing 0s or 1s. The Markov chain describes the probability, for each square on the 3x3 grid, of putting a 1 instead of 0 on that square.

The second contains people who choose the coefficients for the first few spherical harmonics—representing the probability where on the Bloch sphere the basis of quantum measurement is chosen. The Markov chain describes the probability, for each square on the 3x3 grid, of which basis to measure in.

Then, we compare the results of each population using [Kuiper's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper%27s_test) or some other [goodness-of-fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit) test to see if they are truly coming from the same distribution. Uniformly distributed Markov coefficients should result in uniform results in the limit as the population and sample sizes go to infinity.

If the test determines the results are not coming from the same distribution, this will indicate that there is a difference between these classical and quantum models!

A postive result like that would mean that performing this experiment with real life people could have the potential of detecting such a model of quantum body language if it exists.

I would expect the quantum distribution to have larger tails than the classical distribution. Which could be detectable.

And that is an exciting prospect.

I haven't found the time to do so yet, but there is enough information here for anyone to code these simulations themself.

### Why? How?

I don't know. Evolution? Before language, evolutionary advantage would be for the group that can communicate better given two otherwise equal packs. Evolution is pretty good at searching large solution spaces.

It reminds me of [this article](https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/) describing how an artificially evolved [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) learned to exploit magnetic side-effects to arrive at a solution. Yeah it may be artificial, but so are forest fire and viral disease simulations and they aren't useless to learn from.

### The brain may use quantum mechanics, but how can entanglement occur over the air?

Don't know that either. Skepticism is healthy and should be maintained. Don't forget that not even long ago suggesting a quantum aspect to the brain would be laughed at. Now nature has been proven cleverer than us once again.

Is biological entanglement over the air that much more of an impossibility? The body is strong enough [to glow](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006256&type=printable).

It would be nice if:

- This is true.
- It requires sufficient empathy to function and be experienced.
- It becomes trendy to try this out.

Maybe such could encourage positive shift towards increased empathy across the globe?

How many empathy-deficient people would work to better themselves for the opportunity to experience something that feels like magic?

Could really use something like that about now.
