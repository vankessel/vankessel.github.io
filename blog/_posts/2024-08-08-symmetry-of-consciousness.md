# {{ page.title }}

Where to start with the hard problem of consciousness?

I think the best place to start is to identify any symmetries.

Symmetry is the building block of everything. Not atoms or quarks.

Whereever they can be found in the physical world, a physical conservation law will follow. And vice-versa.

Whereever they can be found in the mental world, will a mental conservation law follow?

Will mental conservation laws preceed mental symmetries?

Can we identify any mental conservation laws or symmetries?

## Possible Mental Conservation Laws

### Identity

Identity appears to be conserved.

In the sense that you always identify with something. Not that it is unchanging. Or that you are conscious of the fact.

Ego-death is not a valid counter-example. It can feel like a loss of personal identity, but only as a side effect of removing the barrier between "self" and "other." Identity is not lost, it becomes unbounded. It is feeling of "unity" and "oneness" often described by those who've experienced it.

I conjecture that as long as a being is conscious, it is identifying. It does not need to be able to of concieve it.

Even without thought, a being will identitify with their phenomenal experience as there is no way for that consciousness to be aware of any separation.

This simple example consciousness is composed of only two things— 1: Phenomena ("There are things") 2: An experience from a point of view (These things are "_happening_"). Without the ability to make distinctions, the two become one and the same. The experiencer is identified with its phenomena automatically, no thought required.

If this is a valid interpretation, can this be used as a starting point that could make a dent in the hard problem? Can we concieve such a mental conservation law that could be experimentally verified or have predictive modelling power?

Momentum is conserved through the translation symmetry of spacetime, and we see that when objects collide and change velocity.

Energy is conserved through the time-translation symmetry of spacetime, and we see that when objects collide and change velocity.

## Possible Mental Symmetries

Pre-birth and post-death seem to likely be the same state of (non-)consciousness. That would make the two ends of every lifetime symmetric.

Such an unchanging null state seems in ways similar to an [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element).

Are all conscious experiences symmetric? Like how you may consider different [permutations of a Rubik's cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube_group) to be symmetric despite the labels not matching?

Would this mean [Lie Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_theory), the study of continuous symmetries, can be applied to our continuous experience from birth to death?

At any instant, are we are moving infinitesimally in a direction tangent to the manifold of [phenomenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon#Philosophy) experiences?

What would the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space) of the manifold of experiences represent?

Will sure feels like it directs experience. Is our will the tangent space?

Is any of this testable?

Is all of reality all one big loan on zero?

Need a red color charge for your quark? Have to take green and blue too. Virtual particles. Etc.

So on and so on until there are enough symmetries for there to be a mechanism that separates matter from anti-matter long enough for us all to be born and be awfully dramatic about it.
