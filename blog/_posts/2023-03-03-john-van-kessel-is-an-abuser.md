John van Kessel, former owner of the Beachside Motel in Penticton, British Columbia, also threatened violence & kidnapping, is incredibly racist, and is a generally terrible narcissistic human being you shouldn't associate with.

Last night was the first night in my new home, and I had to defend myself from John van Kessel when he assaulted me (Johannes Antonius van Kessel from Canada, in and around BC/Saskatchewan). My Mom had bought place for herself and let me move in downstairs in the for a bit. Dad is divorced and is helping us move. Part of the reason I wanted to move was to escape the trauma I experienced in my last home. Moving had been stressful and put everyone a little on edge. We are mostly moved in and I was looking forward to setting up my living space but was mocked saying I would never unless I was forced to. Fairly innocuous by itself but coming at the end of several days of similar comments. I would have began to explain to my mom that these little comments were getting at me and I'm feeling unappreciated.

I never got to say most of that, because he aggressively entered the kitchen from the living room as I did nothing but sit and speak. Then he tightly gripped my wrists enough to hurt them and restrain me.

I told him I wasn't doing anything and to stop escalating. He did not listen.
I tried to back up. He pushed me back into and over my chair.
I told him again to let go and stop escalating. He gripped harder.
I got one hand free, but couldn't get the other, so I punched him to free myself.
My instinct was to punch full force at his chin like one should, but I changed course to the side of his neck and lowered my strength.

It worked. But he pretends to be dumber than he actually is to get away with things, he's told me that many times. There's a reason I was able to release one arm and not the other. He was goading me into having to punch him so he could escalate further while blaming me for it. Now he's trying to play me off as the abuser to my mom. That she should get rid of me. Mom stopped him, but he then threatened that he could actually "hurt me if he really wanted." He did have that look in his eyes.

Mom told me to hide in my bedroom while he cooled down. I wish she kicked him out until he apologized.

I wanted to go to bed, but was too afraid to leave my bedroom to brush and take out my contacts while he is up. He stayed up nearly all night, so I couldn't leave until 3-5am when he usually falls asleep after staying up too long or drinking enough beers. I left for the day but had to come back in the evening because I had nowhere else to go. My mom told me he was better now and probably won't say anything about it. Okay. Wait. Has he taken any responsibility? No.

Then they took us to a pub for dinner where I had to pretend to be okay sitting next to him. Because stability is more valuable than my feelings. I've always been taught that my feelings are worth less than everyone else's. We all walk on eggshells around my dad, but we're so used to it we barely even notice we're doing it. We dare never criticize his ways as children because we knew what would happen. We learned quick to keep our mouths shut and just appease him.

How long are we going to put up with his bullshit? Why can he throw a tantrum as old man and we actually cater to it? Why do I have to pretend things are okay and do things to make _him_ feel better when I was the one hurt?

He never sees any punishment for the terrible things he does. He's very racist against Indian, Asian, and Black people. He's transphobic against transgender people. He makes fun of strangers for things behind their back for no reason at all. He makes fun of fat girls, but not fat men. And rarely in front of their faces.

He asked my mom for a divorce because he thought he could do better. But the man literally looks up to Johnny Bravo I kid you not. No self-respecting woman will touch him with a ten foot pole and now he's trying to sneak his way back with Mom and she doesn't want it. Wonder if that's related to him saying he will come back to forcibly remove me.

He has done so much bad to so many people and has never seen justice. He shows no remorse or interest in improving. He's been a lead weight of negativity dragging our whole family down and it's time we cut him out our lives. He can either change his ways and stop being a bad person or cut him out our lives. I can't stand, but understand, that my mom wants to return to status quo, but I will not compromise my values for a hateful old piece of shit.

He can not come to my wedding or any other big life events unless he genuinely turns himself around, and apologizes too, but I doubt he will. This page can stay up until then too, the least justice you can receive is everyone knowing who you really are.
