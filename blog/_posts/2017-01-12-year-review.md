title: 2016: Nasa and Data Slavery

================

2016 has been a busy and exciting year. As much as people like to announce their displeasure with the it, it has been a year of personal development for me.

I got my first development job over the summer with [Data Nerds](). I was not expecting such a welcoming and friendly atmosphere for my first job. It is exactly what one would expect a modern tech company to be, and I mean that in best sense. Fantastic coworkers, meaningful work, inviting culture, and of course, table-tennis. I'll try to keep the shilling to a minimum, but it's nice to feel my work is valued even though I'm new in the field and still have lots to learn. I began as a "Data Slave", collecting and processing data, but slowly got more responsibilities and more engaging tasks. The most interesting task I completed was my "Raper-Scraper", a program which collects data on every sexual offender in the United States. It's strange to think that my work may one day may actually prevent a case of sexual abuse.

My second achievement last year was [contributing code to Nasa]()! It was a simple fix, but I am very proud to be able to say that Nasa uses my code.
