================

On the 14th this year, I went to the pacific northwest regionals of the ACM programming competition.

That's me on the right there. The competition was hosted at the beautiful SFU Surrey campus in vancouver. It ended up being loads of fun.
There were a lot a interesting and challenging questions and we ended up solving 6 out of 11 getting 31st (59th percentile) out of the 75 teams in our division.

We were very close to getting one additional question, but it was failing on some edge-case that we just could not discover.
I am a little disappointed we could not figure it out in time, because that would have bumped us up to 18th place (76th percentile).
I can not complain though, overall I am proud of how we performed for a team that has never participated in a programming competition before.
The next time we compete I am confident that we will do even better.
