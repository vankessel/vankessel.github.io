Disclaimer: Don't take anything too seriously. I enjoy taking ideas to their logical extremes just to see where things may lead. In this case, it has led to an experiment that should be able to detect the presence of a quantum advantage across all sorts of weird phenomena.

Okay, maybe take it a _little_ bit seriously. How cool would it be if some of this wild nonsense were actually true? You're a _damned liar_ if you say the prospect doesn't excite you even a bit.

It's okay! _Breathe_. We _can_ talk about this stuff as long as we don't commit any logical fallacies! I try not to make any but am only human. Let me know if there are any and I'll try to correct them.

## Speaking without speaking

Did you know it is [not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5qx3cw/connected_as_one_with_hours_of_telepathy/) too [uncommon](https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/86w79u/i_think_my_girlfriend_and_i_are_beginning_to/dw8ecnz/) for [people](https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/apfdkn/do_you_guys_believe_in_telepathy_using_lsd/eg83yvb/) to [experience telepathy on psychedelics](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Psychedelic-Telepathy%3A-An-Interview-Study-Johnstad/d9475810ce25186dab52830b7735f5a905a80dc1)?

Explanations usually fall into two categories:

1. It's mere hallucination.
2. It's mere body language.

I've experienced this myself twice with a friend. It feels distinctly unique. I may be wrong but lean towards option two.

Not _mere_ body language though. Enhanced somehow. Possibly by quantum mechanics.

The brain is not "too warm & wet for quantum mechanics," as [proven this April](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07936). (Tryptophan is a key player. Curious, considering the connection to psychedelics.)

Telepathy is a misnomer. There is [no communication of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy). Telempathy is a better name for it.

How is there an advantage if there is no communication of information?

Like a [quantum algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm), we can [exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality) [quantum correlations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_correlation) to [do something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP) that [appears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy) [remarkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm).

## The experiment

None of this useful if something can't be made [falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) and tested. Thankfully I can think of a way we can possibly detect any quantum advantage.

### Null hypothesis

Telempathy is either not physically real, or does not require quantum entanglement to function.

### Experiment

Two players experiencing telempathy attempt to cooperatively win [the Mermin-Peres magic square game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy#The_magic_square_game). This game can only be won 8/9 of the time classically, and 100% of the time with one pair of entangled qubits.

### Best case success

Telempathic coordination is easy. The players win statistically-significantly more than 8/9 of the time.

### Worst case success

Telempathic coordination is hard. The players win statistically-significantly more than a pair of AI models trained to replicate their decision probabilities. (Failing to beat 8/9 may just mean there is noise. In this case the baseline to compare against should be a purely classical simulation of the players.) Perhaps a sufficiently high-order Markov chain. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this statistically.

## The Mermin-Peres magic squares game

In [this game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy#The_magic_square_game) a random row and column of a 3x3 grid are assigned to two players. Each doesn't know which row or column the other got. Players may strategize beforehand but may not communicate while playing. One must fill their row with an odd number of 1s, and the other must fill their column with an odd number of 0s.

To win, they must both make the same choice where the row and column overlap.

Classically, the best strategy is to memorize the a solution which fills the grid correctly for all but 1 of the 9 squares.

With a single entangled qubit, the players can win every time. No additional information required.

## Testing

Thankfully each round of the game doesn't take long to complete so gathering data shouldn't be too painful.

Players should be separated well enough to minimize [sensory-leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_leakage), but not so far than testing becomes impossible if distance or physical obstacles do matter.

Will probably need to model this as a beta-binomial distribution.

I'll give it a try and provide an update later. Let me know if you try something yourself.

## FAQ

### What does it feel like?

Like multiple consciousnesses are "in the same room" so to speak. Can be very uncomfortable at first, realizing the lack of privacy and trying to fight off inappropriate intrusive thoughts. But if there is no information transfer than this lack of privacy is more felt and actual.

### What else may this apply to?

Any so called "quantum woo" or phenomena that can be claimed to function using quantum mechanics. This experiment could be modified to test if there's a QM aspect to remote viewing or the law of attraction if such things exist.

### Why? How?

Evolution maybe? Before language, evolutionary advantage would be for the group that can communicate better given two otherwise equal packs of humans. Evolution is pretty good a searching large solution spaces.

It reminds me of [this article](https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/) describing how an artificially evolved FPGA learned to exploit magnetic side-effects to arrive to a solution. Yeah it may be artificial, but so are forest fire and viral disease simulations and they aren't useless for learning from.

[Some suggest](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265935637_The_Electromagnetic_Induction_of_Mystical_and_Altered_States_within_the_Laboratory) magnetic fields are involved.

### What may help?

Maybe:

Psychedelics. I don't recommended these if they are illegal for you where you are. I suspect Ketamine, LSD, DMT, and psilocybin mushrooms may help induce such a state, in approximate order of effectiveness.

Meditation.

Music or binaural beats. (Acoustic [entrainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment).)

Electromagnetic [shielding/stimulation/entrainment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265935637_The_Electromagnetic_Induction_of_Mystical_and_Altered_States_within_the_Laboratory).

### This is woo nonsense

Yeah probably. Lots of speculation. But I think it's fun to have found a plausible experiment, which is what matters.

### This is not woo nonsense...

On the chance I end up being _too right_, should I mention I'm not suicidal, clumsy, or hang out around open windows?

Haha, just kidding... Sort of. Is your shadow org hiring?

## What might happen if this is true?

Hopefully evidence that all people are connected will lead to a little bit more peace and empathy for everyone.

It's hard to be mad at anyone you share a mind with.

If the chance is at all non-zero, it is worth the effort.
