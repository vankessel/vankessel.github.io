On the 14th of November this year, I went to the Pacific Northwest regionals of the ACM programming competition.

That's our team coach, Dr. Bowen Hui, my teammates Emerson and Ashley, and myself. The competition was hosted at the beautiful SFU Surrey campus in Vancouver. Food was provided throughout the event alongside lots and lots of coffee as can be expected from a room full of programmers.
There were a lot a interesting and challenging questions and we ended up solving 6 out of 11 getting 31st (59th percentile) out of the 75 teams in our division.

We were very close to getting one additional question, but it was failing on some edge-case that we just could not discover.
I can not complain though, overall I am proud of how we performed for a team that has never participated in a programming competition before.
The next time we compete I am confident that we will do even better.
