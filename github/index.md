### Summary
This web application allows a group of people to visualize how their individual schedules overlap.
This aids in deciding when to hold an event.

### Use
Users enter their schedule into the "Editor" tab by changing the colours of each cell.

Red indicates a time that they are unavailable, blue indicates a time that they are available, and green indicates a time that they are unsure.

Each user's unique IDs are entered into the "Heat Map" tab's text box separated by commas to generate the heat map for the IDs.

### Next
To improve overall user-friendliness, and to add selection abilities so users do not have to unnecessarily click repeatedly.

### Summary
This is small command line based Rubik's cube simulator. Not particularly useful but it was fun to implement.

### Use
Enter [basic rubik's cube commands](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/3x3x3_notation#Basic_Cube_Notation). The program will output an unfolded Rubik's cube where each color is represented by a character.

### Next
Appropriately color each character in the console.
