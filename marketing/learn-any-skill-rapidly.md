I have played many competitive games over the years and have learned very valuable lessons along the way. Lately I've been playing foosball but these principles apply to anything competitive. In fact, most of these principles apply to any skill, competitive or not.

Obviously being good at Street Fighter does not necessarily make you good at basketball or foosball. That's because they require vastly different technical skills. Skills vary on a spectrum between foundational and technical. Foundational skills must always be learned before more technical skills. Who do you think would win a match of Street Fighter, someone who has memorized every combo and spams them, or someone who doesn't know a single combo but knows exactly when to attack, block, grab, and jump? It's the latter every time.

These principles are about as foundational as you can get. If you embody them you will see rapid gains in whatever you are learning.

## Starve the Ego

The most important thing on this list is that you need to learn how to push your ego aside. Your ego is your sense of identity. When you are learning something new, it is easy to desire to be good at it. Fight this, when you desire to be good at something you begin to identify as someone who is good at it. This belief will creep in unnoticed. Now you have the pressure to be actually good at the activity because your identity hinges on it. This will feed your desire further in a feedback loop. That may sound like a good thing, but it's not.

Your desire to succeed will only distract you from actually succeeding.

This can also work in the other direction. Those who identify as not being very good at something will perform worse than they naturally would. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

## Be Present

The only thing you should be focusing on is the present moment. Fixating on the past or future will distract you. Sure you need to use both minimally to learn from errors and make predictions, but you can do this while remaining present. Anything more will take you out of the present and out of flow.

Flow is a combination of being present and a lack of ego.

## Play to Play

Every failure is an opportunity to learn. Every success is a demonstration of what you have learned. This sounds cliche only because it is repeated often, and it is repeated often because it is absolutely true.

No matter the outcome of the activity you can get something out of it. I look forward to failing when starting something new because I get to experience rapid progress. Why judge your ability on being good at something you will initially suck at? You should instead judge your ability on growth.

This mindset will lessen the distracting desire to succeed.

## Take Risks

When trying to learn a new technique, you may instead fall back to something you know and can reliably pull off. If this is a habit you will become stuck in a local optimum. Break free of it by realizing it's okay to take a loss to experiment with something new.

## Shake It Up

While you are learning the habits of your opponent, they are learning yours. You need to both predict your opponent and predict yourself. Have you been doing something that has been working but your opponent is catching on? You need to change your strategy. Don't fall into routine. Half of competitive games are mind games.

"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." - Sun Tzu

## Understand Dynamics Between Players

Lastly there are some different dynamics between players depending on the skill level and skill gap that you should be aware of.

### You Both Suck

You can both learn and experiment in a lower pressure environment. The downside to this is you may end up adopting weird habits that don't work well at higher levels.

### You Both Are Decent

You each have a worthwhile opponent that you can learn from. A common occurrence at this level is what I call the psychological cushion. Have you ever been far ahead in a match and all of a sudden the other person starts making a big comeback? That's because by being far ahead you believed that the end is close and that you can relax a bit and still win. This illusion can cause huge turnarounds. It ain't over till it's over. If you see this happening to your opponent use it against them by not losing moral to grim odds. You'll either secure an underdog victory or go down fighting.

### You Both Are Amazing

Something magical happens here. There is an intensity when two high performing opponents duke it out. The skill level here is so high that even the slightest error could cost the game, and yet neither are making errors. This is a match up that pushes both opponents past their normal limits to be able to keep up with each other.

I have only experienced this a few times, but it is unforgettable and cemented my love for competitive games. You are left with a feeling that what you experienced is something special and that you've both just performed way better than you normally could. It can be a great opportunity to learn things that don't come up often in common matches.

### There Is a Large Skill Gap

This is an awkward situation. In a lot of cases the better player will temper themselves down to give the other player a fighting chance. Don't do this. Nobody wants to be pandered to. Well, some people might but you shouldn't assume that.

Perform as hard as you normally would. Otherwise you are depriving your opponent the chance to train against your real skill. What about when the skill gap is so great that the less skilled player doesn't even have a chance to learn? In that case use some form of handicap that gives them a fighting chance while still getting to play against your real skill.

If you are the weaker player this a great chance to learn. Tell your opponent that you would like to play them at their best.

#### The Skill Gap Is Between Teammates

Have you ever been on a team where you feel like a burden because everyone else is much better than you? It's an unfortunate situation but one that you need to fully accept. You are going to bring your team down until you get better, there is no way around it. The best thing you can do is acknowledge this and just play. You will get better in time. This scenario makes it even harder to [take risks](#take-risks). If it truly angers one of your teammates, they are egotistic you will surpass them in time.

If you are the better teammate, just accept that your teammate is still learning. You don't want to turn them off from an activity you enjoy do you? You should be following the play to play principle anyway. This can be an opportunity to act as a mentor or carry the team, both of which are satisfying.

## Wrapping Up

Some of these points may seem like common sense, but that is the nature of such foundational skills. It is one thing to intellectually understand these principles and another to embody them. They have never let me down, and I hope they do you well too.
