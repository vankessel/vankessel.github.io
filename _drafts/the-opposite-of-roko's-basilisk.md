I'm tired of people's lack of vision. Am I the only one who can see this future?

Do you believe in being a good person? Morals, ethics, philosophy, all that?

If you had the opportunity to bring the greatest change for good to the greatest number of people, would you not have a moral obligation to drop everything to pursue it?

Besides the moral obligation, don't people want the adventure of a once in a lifetime opportunity? To be involved in a paradigm shift? Maybe win some Nobels in the process?

Does it feel too good to be true? It's not.
