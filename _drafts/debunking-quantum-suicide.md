Overview of argument
Personal proof vs objective proof

Transforming the thought experiment
Testing the new experiment
Proving to oneself

One or more of these assumptions must be false:
Quantum suicide is true.
The transformation is logically equivalent.
Time is not relevant, every quantum chance that ever has or will be decide has done so
in a way to funnel us down the reality in which we live the longest.
