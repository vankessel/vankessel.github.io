<div markdown=1 style="display: inline-block">

Two things are clear. I exist. A world exists.

The nature of my existence is subjective. Impersistent. Irrational. Personal. Driven by desire and emotion, a quest for purpose.

The nature of the world is objective. Persistent. Rational. Shared. Driven by forces unknown, devoid of meaning.

The two are dual.

The infinite gulf between them is [the Absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism); a tragic compulsion to seek meaning where there is none.

The curse is obvious. The blessing, not so much.

<div markdown=1 style="display: inline-block">

I am Sisyphus.

I've spent countless lives pushing my boulder.

Never quite reaching the top of the mountain.

I know my curse.

But to let myself hope gives me the resolve to push at all.

What better way to spend eternity than chasing a dream that will never extinguish?

I gladly embrace my mad fate.

---

With each decision I bear the weight of an entire world.

I know they will take me nowhere.

Yet I rejoice in the freedom I have in the ways I can go nowhere.

In fact, I have a surplus of freedom.

If the world refuses to give me a purpose, perhaps I can craft one.

Which of my freedoms can I part with?

I will pick the ones I value least.

Did I choose them because they are immoral, or are they immoral because I've chosen them?

Regardless, my shadow is rejected.

I know good and evil.

---

I have three duties:

To discover these values.

To release myself from fraudulent values.

To use my will in alignment with my values.

---

We live in a determined, mechanical world.

Yet each of us has the ability to exert our will upon it.

Is that not the power of a god?
