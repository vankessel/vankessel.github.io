e and sqrt(e) have ugly extra 1 in expansion.

Forward and backward Kessel expansions include initial 1/1 term. (Denominator = 1 because that's the product of zero terms.)

TODO:

Rewrite Engel and Pierce expansion articles/conclusions with Forward and Backward Kessel expansions

Can I find equivalent to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_continued_fraction_formula for Engel (0, ∞), Pierce (0, 1), and Kessel (0,1)/(1, ∞) expansions?

Forward Kessel Expansion (1, ∞) of x = Engel Expansion of x-1
Backward Kessel Expansion (0,1) of x = Pierce Expansion of 1-x

Overtone sequences?
