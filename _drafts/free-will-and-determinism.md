# {{ page.title }}

The age old debate between whether we operate under [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) or that our actions are purely [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) is one that seems like it may never have a resolution. Most people have a hard stance on the matter one way or the other, but I argue that they are not mutually exclusive and can be reconciled. Upon doing research for this post I have learned that this stance is called [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism).

This may seem very contradictory at first, but consider this. We experience free will in our day to day conscious existence. Rather than deduce this knowledge by perception like we do for knowledge of the physical world, this knowledge is first-hand. In a way this knowledge is more "real" than anything we can determine about the physical world. On the other hand, every phenomena of the physical world appears deterministic and [casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality). Even quantum mechanics doesn't violate this under the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation), or the more interesting [many-minds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-minds_interpretation).

So both seem to be correct. Perhaps this is because they are both correct and the traditional argument is a [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma)? Let's see if there's a way to reconcile this. First, we need to come up with a concrete definition of a conscious mind.

## Defining a Person

If overnight everyone's body changed to be identical, how would you tell people apart? The obvious answer is to talk to and question them. The reason being is that each individual will have a unique response. We must also consider that this response may change with time. For example, if a dog lover gets attacked by dogs, they may now dislike dogs. So, the response from an individual depends on two things: What they are currently perceiving (their external **environment**.), and what they have perceived previously (their internal **state**).

Being a function of environment and state sounds very deterministic, and it is. If there is truly random chance to our decisions, could we even call ourselves an individual? Even if a choice feels like it has randomness to it, or that we have no preference, when it comes down to it we do eventually make a decision. In fact, maybe we shouldn't call it free will. It may not be free, but it doesn't make it any less *yours*. Let's simply call it **will**.

<!-- Not sure if I like the following argument. May reword, or reconsider my opinion on this. -->

So if our actions are deterministic, why do we experience free will? Some may say it is an illusion. This doesn't sit well with me. Yes, our minds are susceptible to illusions, but the mind is not the same as consciousness. The mind refines and biases the input we initially receive from the environment, and deterministically drives our ultimate decision. Consciousness is the interface between experiencing and acting; it is the observer takes an input to an output. Illusions occur in the processing of the mind and are interpreted by the consciousness the best it can, it's not the consciousness fault it's being tricked, it's simply receiving a warped input. Free will feels like something fundamental to consciousness itself.
