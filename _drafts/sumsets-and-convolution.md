Fails as a metric because d(A, A) is not always zero, but it _is_ always centered at zero. Sort of equivalent to a standard deviation and mean zero? Can this be thought of as a kind of more generalized metric? Does this more accurately capture physics since the distance from an electron to itself should be fuzzy since the position is fuzzy?

Minkowski addition is equivalent to convolution of f and g where the function is > 0 when in the set and 0 when not. Also corresponds to random variable addition.
