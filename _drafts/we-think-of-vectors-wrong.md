# We Think of Vectors Wrong

It's human intuition to think of vectors as little arrows.

What if I told you that's the wrong way to think about them? At least from the perspective of what's most mathematically natural.

Mathematics always seems to like it best when you set objects to zero. Multiplicative groups like the complex unit circle exist that only have 1, no 0. But they are always subsets of a larger space that contains 0. Even in those cases, it almost feels like 1 is acting like a substitute 0. Pseudo-zero, the next best thing. It's so gross to not include at least 1 or 0 that we prefix objects like that with ["quasi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasigroup) and ["semi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup).

That's why nature uses complex numbers, not just real. Because not all polynomials have sensible solutions when set equal to 0 unless you use complex numbers. Real numbers are an interesting and useful subset of complex numbers, but less "natural" in a sense.

Natural numbers can be [represented as nested empty sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers).
