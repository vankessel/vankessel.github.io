AKA how to _really_ divide by zero

The set theoretic definition of the naturals is misleading. It describes not the integers themselves, but the intervals [0, n], which are isomorphic to the integers.

The fact that every integer under this definition contains all the previous is equivalent to saying any interval [0, n] contains all smaller intervals [0, m] where m < n.

This can be strengthened.

All the possible subintervals contained within interval [0, n] is equivalent to the power set (set of all subsets) of n

The interval [0, n] contains not only
