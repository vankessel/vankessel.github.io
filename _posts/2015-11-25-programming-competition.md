================

On the 14th this year, I went to the pacific northwest regionals of the ACM programming competition.

That's me on the right there. It was hosted at the beautiful SFU Surrey campus in vancouver. It ended up being loads of fun.
There were a lot a interesting and challenging questions and we ended up solving 6 out of 11 getting 31st place.
We had one more question "correct" but it was failing on some obscure edge case which is unfortunate because the question was quite
easy. Had we got that one extra question it would have bumped up us to at least 18th place. You can check out the exact standings
and questions for our year (and any other year) [here.](http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/results.htm)
